# Introduction

In this homework, you are to implement several binary classification algorithms, including logistic regression, pocket algorithm (improved perceptron), soft-margin SVM, Naive Bayes, and Gaussian discriminative analysis (GDA), and apply your completed algorithms to multiple different datasets to see their pros and cons.

* You will play with simple linear and quadratic data that are separable by a linear boundary or circle (each point is a data instance: red and blue for different classes) and noisy linear data whose training data are generated by a linear boundary with some noise (so not linearly separable).

# Question 0: Read the instructions (0 pts)

* Please read `HW2+3.pdf` and `HW2+3.ppt` for some more details and instructions of the homework.





# Question 1: Logistic regression (20 pts)

* You will implement logistic regression (using MLE) in this question. You are to amend your implementation into `Classification.py`.

* There are many sub-functions in `Classification.py`. You can ignore all of them but `def logistic_train`, `def linear_model_accuracy`, `def main` and `def sigmoid`. 

* In `main`, you will see a general pipeline of machine learning: <br/>
  - Loading data: `X_train, Y_train, X_val, Y_val, X_test, Y_test = data_loader(args)`, in which each `X` is a D-by-N matrix (numpy array) and each column is a data instance. You can type `X[:, 0]` to extract the "first" data instance from `X`. (Caution! python and numpy's indices start from 0. That is, to get the first element in a vector, the index is 0 rather than 1.) <br/>
  - Initialize the parameters
  - Learning patterns: `w, b = logistic_train(X_train, Y_train, w, b, step_size=step_size, max_iterations=max_iterations)`, in which the code takes `X_train` and the desired labels `Y_train` as input and output the weights `w` and the bias `b`.
  - Apply the learned patterns to the data: `training_accuracy = linear_model_accuracy(X_train, Y_train, w, b)`, `validation_accuracy = linear_model_accuracy(X_val, Y_val, w, b)`, and `test_accuracy = linear_model_accuracy(X_test, Y_test, w, b)` to compute the training, validation, and test error.

* In `def logistic_train`, you are to implement the training process of logistic regression (using MLE), using gradient descent.

* In `def linear_model_accuracy`, you can see how the accuracy (for training, validation, or test data) is computed.

* `def sigmoid` implements the sigmoid function.

* **You will see similar code structure for other questions!**
  
## Coding (10/20 pts):

You have one part to implement:

* The function `def logistic_train`: please go to the function and read the input format, output format, and the instructions carefully. You can assume that the actual inputs will follow the input format, and your goal is to generate the required numpy arrays (`w` and `b`), the weights and bias of a linear classifier. Please make sure that your results follow the required numpy array shapes. You are to implement your code between `### Your job Q1 starts here ###` and `### Your job Q1 ends here ###`. Note that, `1` has not been appended into `X` and we define `tilde_X`for you. You are free to create more space between those two lines: we include them just to explicitly tell you where you are going to implement.

* **Please read `HW2+3.pdf` and `HW2+3.ppt` for what training objective we want you to minimize.**

## Play with different datasets (Task 1 - linear testing, 2/20 pts):

* You may play with other commands by (1) changing the learning rate (step_size) `--step_size 0.1` to other numbers (you may try a number `10**c`, where `c` is an integer). You will see that, with too large step_sizes, the algorithm may not coverge; (2) changing the number of iterations `--max_iterations 500` to some smaller (or larger) numbers.

## Play with different datasets (Task 4 - mnist data, 2/20 pts):

# (Bonus) Question 6: Naive Bayes nonlinear classifier (15 pts)

* You will implement the Naive Bayes algorithm for nonlinear classification in this question. You are to amend your implementation into `Classification.py`.

* There are many sub-functions in `Classification.py`. You can ignore all of them but `def NB_nonlinear_train`, `def NB_nonlinear_model_accuracy`, `def main`. The main contents of `def main` is the same as in Question 1.

* In `def NB_nonlinear_train`, you are to implement the training process of Naive Bayes, using the "closed-form" solution.

* ** In `def NB_nonlinear_model_accuracy`, you are to implement the classification rule of Naive Bayes and calculate the accuracy on a data set.
  
## Coding (10/15 pts):

You have two parts to implement:

* The function `def NB_nonlinear_train`: please go to the function and read the input format, output format, and the instructions carefully. You can assume that the actual inputs will follow the input format, and your goal is to generate the required numpy arrays (parameters of Naive Bayes) of a nonlinear Naive Bayes classifier. Please make sure that your results follow the required numpy array shapes. You are to implement your code between `### Your job Q6.1 starts here ###` and `### Your job Q6.1 ends here ###`. You are free to create more space between those two lines: we include them just to explicitly tell you where you are going to implement.

* The function `def NB_nonlinear_model_accuracy`: please go to the function and read the input format, output format, and the instructions carefully. You can assume that the actual inputs will follow the input format, and your goal is to compute the accuracy. You are to implement your code between `### Your job Q6.2 starts here ###` and `### Your job Q6.2 ends here ###`. You are free to create more space between those two lines: we include them just to explicitly tell you where you are going to implement.

* **Please read `HW2+3.pdf` and `HW2+3.ppt` for what training process/objective we want you to implement/minimize.**

## Play with different datasets and discuss (5/15 pts):

* Please run the following commands<br/>
`python3 Classification.py --algorithm NB_nonlinear --data linear --feature linear`<br/>
`python3 Classification.py --algorithm NB_nonlinear --data quadratic --feature linear`<br/>
`python3 Classification.py --algorithm NB_nonlinear --data quadratic --feature quadratic`<br/>
`python3 Classification.py --algorithm NB_nonlinear --data noisy_linear --feature linear`<br/>
`python3 Classification.py --algorithm NB_nonlinear --data mnist --feature linear`<br/>
